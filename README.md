# Galvanize Individual Project Proposal

## Project Description
My project is going to be a web app that a user can type a city in a text box, and get a list of neighborhoods in the area. The list will also show crime statistics ratings.


## Who uses it?
My targeted audience would be young professionals who are relocating to a new city for work or just because. It could also be targeted at anyone traveling to a city for vacation.

## What outputs do they need?
The outputs that will be needed will be a basic text box to type the city in which they plan to move to. I will need to send the city to an api that would return crime rate statistics for the cities neighborhoods.

## What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
an api that will return both the neighborhoods in the city and crime rates.

## What technologies do you plan to use?
List of Technologies
HTML
CSS
Javascript
jquery
A custom api since I can find one that suites my needs (city search will be limited to what I add to the api)
I will include a city, and the main neighborhoods in the city. Also I will include a crime rate number based on crime statistics for the area.
Possibly Google Maps api

## Feature list
Feature List
Material design (ish)
A text box to type city
A search button
A list of cities that fit the criteria
A form for feedback
If I can get it to work, a map, that will plot the cities on a map when you click them.
This will allow the user to visualize exactly where the location is.
I plan to design for both mobile and desktop.
